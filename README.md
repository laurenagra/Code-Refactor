## Built this project to better optimize and break down the code within to allow for better accessibility and to make it more available for responsive web use.

-Previously, the use of many divs would have made it difficult for the webpage to be truly responsive. By implementing a main container and various section tags, the code is able to allow user focus on the main content of the page, as well as introduces an aside as an actual aside so users may focus on the main content. 

-In this, I learned more about the tag asides and how it functions, as well as how to better segment off my code to allow for proper focus.
